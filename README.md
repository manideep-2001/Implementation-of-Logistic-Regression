# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression

ABC bank assigned a project to the data scientist to a model to detect credit card fraud transactions using Logistic Regression to reduce fraud transactions. For that project, the data scientist began with a problem statement to understand the given dataset, and the data scientist dive into a dataset to analyze the given description attributes for target variables with the help of data Preprocessing after that data scientist performed Exploratory data analysis to investigations on data so as to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations to process next step towards Feature Engineering for features selection to apply logistic regression model for prediction. 

Problem statement: Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm used to make predictions to find the value of a dependent variable such as the condition of a tumor (malignant or benign), classification of email (spam or not spam), or admission into a university (admitted or not admitted) by learning from independent variables (various features relevant to the problem).
Difference between Logistic and Linear Regression The major difference between Logistic and Linear Regression is that Linear Regression is used to solve regression problems whereas Logistic Regression is used for classification problems.

# About the dataset

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
The creditcard.csv dataset contains 31 columns and 284807 rows, Indexes are 
Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset,
V1 - V28: may be the result of a PCA Dimensionality reduction to protect user identities and sensitive features(v1-v28,),
Amount: Transaction amount,
Class: 1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 otherwise.

# Expected output

Use a histogram to represent all the data.
Use Classification Report for scores.
Plot confusion matrix.
